Tinyapp

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).




This app was published for learning purposes. It is not intended for use in production-grade software.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.
